Goodness of fit is a measure of how well an observed frequency distribution fits to a known distribution. For each observed frequency $O_i$ and expected frequency $E_i$, the chi-square statistic is defined as
$$X^2=\sum\frac{\left(O_i-E_i\right)^2}{E_i}=\sum\frac{O_i^2}{E_i}-N$$
where $N$ is the total number of observations.

The less good the fit, the larger the difference between each observed and expected value, so the greater the value of $X^2$.

The null hypothesis of a chi-squared test states there is no difference between the observed and theoretical distribution, whereas the alternative hypothesis says there is a difference.

The chi-squared distribution is most commonly used to approximate the test statistic $X^2$. Goodness-of-fit tests are always one sided, with the critical region being the set of values that are greater than the critical value of $\chi_v^2\left(\alpha\right)$, where $v$ is the degrees of freedom and $\alpha$ is the significance level. Note that if any parameters of the theoretical distribution are estimated by calculation, then an additional degree of freedom is used up.

The Poisson and geometric distribution have a theoretically infinite number of values for the random variable, so all values greater than or equal to some cut-off $n$ are grouped together such that the observed frequency is non-zero.
