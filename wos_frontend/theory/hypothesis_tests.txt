Hypothesis testing is used to check whether a hypothesis about a population parameter is plausible or not. This is done by choosing a result of the experiment, known as the test stastic, and seeing if there is sufficient evidence to reject a statement, known as the null hypothesis, in support of another statement, referred to as the alternative hypothesis.

This is done by choosing a test statistic T for which we can find the distribution, $P_T$, under $H_0$. Then we identify a rejection region $R\subset\mathbb{R}$ under the assumption that $H_0$ is true for some small probability. This rejection region is called the critical region and the probability is known as the significance level. If the test statistic lies within this critical region then there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.

Tests with alternative hypotheses of the form $H_1$:$p<\ldots$ and $H_1:p>\ldots$ are called one-tailed tests. If $H_1$:$p\neq\ldots$ it is a two-tailed test. For two-tailed tests, there are two critical regions, one at each end of the distribution, each representing a probability region equal to half the significance level.

For instance, consider a test for the probability of success of a binomial distribution. Let the null hypothesis $H_0$ be $p=0.35$, and we wish to test if $p>0.35$ at a significance level of $\alpha=5%$. Assuming $H_0$ is true, $X~B(6,0.35)$, $P\left(X\geq4\right)=0.1174$ and $P\left(X\geq5\right)=0.0223$. We see that $P\left(X\geq5\right)<\alpha$ so the critical region is ${5,\ 6}$.

As a second example, consider accidents at a certain road junction. Before installing a new set of traffic lights, accidents used to occur at the rate of 6 per month, but in the month after the lights were installed, there was only one accident. If we want to test whether the lights have reduced the rate of accidents, we model the number of accidents per month using a Poisson distribution. $H_0$:$\lambda=6$ and $H_1$:$\lambda<6$. Assuming $H_0$ is true, $X~Po(6)$, so $P\left(X\le1\right)=0.0174$; at a significance level of 5%, this suggests there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and show that the lights have reduced the number of accidents.
